# for written-out talks...

Sometimes you want to speak from a written-out script rather than notes. This file demonstrates this approach. Note the use of horizontal rules or second-level headers to start slides and first-level headers to end them. Text between the end of one slide and the start of the next will appear only in the script. (This paragraph follows the title slide. A first-level header is needed to demarcate the start of the script.)

-----

> - text slide with an incremental
> - build

# First-level headers close slides

And those headers appear only in the script. The incremental build is collapsed in the script as well.

## an example table

```{r}
kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5],
      caption="Something about cars")
```

# \ 

If you'd rather have a blank than a bold header in the script, use `# \ ` (*a backslash followed by a space*) to terminate the slide. (An empty header is eliminated by knitting.) A new slide also terminates the previous slide, as in the following examples.

<!-- ## an example graphic -->

<!-- ```{r graph, fig.cap="I think that I shall never see"} -->
<!-- ggplot(trees, aes(Girth, Height)) + -->
<!--     geom_point(color="white") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## ugly examples of custom placement and sizing -->

<!-- ```{r displaced, textblock_width=2.75, textblock_pos=c(0, 1), fig.height=3, fig.width=2, out.height=4, center=T} -->
<!-- p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl))) + -->
<!--     geom_bar(color="white", fill="grey40") + -->
<!--     xlab("Another car thing") -->
<!-- p -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- \begin{textblock}{2.75}(3,2) -->

<!-- Look! a dodgy three-column layout! -->

<!-- With great layout power comes great, etc., etc. -->
<!-- \end{textblock} -->

<!-- \begin{textblock}{2.75}(6,1) -->
<!-- ```{r displaced-over, inside_textblock=T, center=T, out.width=2.75} -->
<!-- p -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Text scaling: \\ -->
<!-- a cautionary tale. -->
<!-- \end{textblock} -->

<!-- \vspace{8\TPVertModule} -->

<!-- # \  -->

<!-- On the script, the `textpos` grid is shrunk down. Note too that `textblock`s take up no vertical space, so to prevent overprinting in the script you must manually insert some vertical space with `\vspace`. Extra vertical space at the bottom of a slide will have no effect on the slide output (just the script). -->

<!-- ## example code display -->

<!-- ```{r code, echo=T} -->
<!-- cor(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1) -->
<!-- cor(anscombe$x2, anscombe$y2) -->
<!-- ``` -->

Definitely don't need to visualize.

# final remark

Nonetheless, don't think plotting the data is synonymous with analyzing it. Let's discuss....
